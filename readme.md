# Fighting Robota

### Description  
Fighting Robota is an autonomous wrestling robot designed to engage in battles without any human control. Using a 32-bit Arduino Due for fast processing, dual DRV8835 motor drivers, and a powerful sensor array, the bot detects opponents and arena edges to maneuver strategically and push rivals off the ring.

### Why I Made the Project  
I’ve always been fascinated by combat robotics but wanted to push beyond the simplicity of sumo robot kits. My goal was to build a faster, smarter robot with better autonomy and mechanical advantage through stronger motors, optimized sensing, and a customized 3D-printed chassis—all while learning about embedded control, simulation, and hardware performance limits.
